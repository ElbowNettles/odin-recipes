README file for my first Odin Project project!

Simple recipe site for practicing the basics of HTML.

Task says: 
"Set up your README.md file and write a brief introduction describing what the current project is and what skills you will have demonstrated once you have completed it. (You can also do this as a self-reflection at the end of the project, which is a good way to review what you have learned.)"

So I guess I'll see you on the other side, future Grel! xx
