    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This tomato pasta is a vegan edit of the 'pappa' our Italian grandparents fed us all the time as kids (one of three courses!).
        It's a kind of pasta soup- the above pic is not an accurate representation. You will need a bowl.</p>
        <p>Chicken stock and butter are replaced, beaten egg is left out, and spinach is added for health.
        Nonna used farfallini, sometimes stelline (my fave), but you can use or throw in whatever.</p>
